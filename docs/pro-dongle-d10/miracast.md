# What is Miracast?

Miracast gives you the ability to showcase Windows devices (Windows 8.1 or later) or Android devices (Android 4.4 or later) with the best quality and sound. EZCast Pro natively supports Miracast for Windows/Android devices. This means you use the built-in mirroring feature of your device without needing to install the EZCast Pro software or app.

Due to a limitation of Miracast technology, only a single device can be streamed at a time. For split screen you need the EZCast Pro [software](quickstart.md##windows-and-macos) or [app](quickstart.md#android-and-ios).
