# What is Chromecast?

Chromecast is the casting technology from Google. With Google Chrome browser and Chrome enabled devices, you can transfer a browser tab, audio/video file, or even the whole computer screen to EZCast Pro Dongle II quickly and conveniently. 

EZCast Pro Dongle II allows up to four Windows , Android and ChromeOS devices to cast to a split screen together using the Chromecast protocol without having to use the app.
