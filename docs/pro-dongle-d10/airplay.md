# What is AirPlay?

AirPlay is Apple's mirroring technology for wirelessly streaming content from Apple devices to AirPlay enabled receivers such as speakers, AV receivers, stereo systems, and TVs.

EZCast Pro Dongle II allows up to four macOS and iOS devices to be mirrored at once on a split screen using the AirPlay protocol without the need for the app.
