# Upgrade Firmware

## Why Update the Firmware? 

To benefit from the latest features of EZCast Pro Dongle II, you can quickly and conveniently install the latest firmware update via the Internet. When upgrading the firmware the previous settings are retained. To do this, the EZCast Pro device must have access to the internet which is indicated by a Wi-Fi icon at the top right of the landing page and an `Infrustructure IP` address on the bottom left, as shown below:
