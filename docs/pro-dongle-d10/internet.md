# Internet Access

## Why does EZCast Pro Dongle II need internet access?

Internet access is required for EZCast Pro Dongle II in the following cases:

* Streaming internet content to EZCast Pro using [Apple AirPlay](airplay.md), [Chromecast](chromecast.md) or the [EZCastPro](ezcastproapp.md).

* Updating the [firmware](firmware-upgrade.md) on your EZCast Pro device.

* To manage your EZCast Pro's Advanced Settings remotely.

* One integrated Wi-Fi network: When all your enddevices and EZCast Pro devices are organized in the same network it illiminates the need to have to switch to EZCast Pro's SSID every time you want to mrror your screen in another room.

    Miracast devices use a wireless display standard which creates a peer-to-peer exclusively for mirroring the screen while remaining simultaneously connect to the same Wi-Fi network it the device was connected to. It is therefore not dependent on EZCast Pro for internet access. See our [Miracast](miracast.md) guide for more information.
