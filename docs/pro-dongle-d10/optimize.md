# Setup Guide

## Desktop Screens

### Dongle Behind the Screen

For a tidy solution, you can connect the EZCast Pro Dongle II directly to the HDMI port of your desktop screen.

### Dongle in Front of the Screen via HDMI Extension

If you are experiencing poor transmission quality, it is probably due to signal interference from the monitor. In this case, connect the EZCast Pro Dongle II to the monitor using the HDMI extension to improve the Wi-Fi signal strength.

## Internet Router Wi-Fi Signal Strength

An internet wifi icon displayed in red refers to poor signal strength between the EZCast Pro Dongle II and your router or access point. This may result in choppy playback of videos and content if the content depends on the Internet or if you allow [Connections](adv.settings.md#Connection_to_Receiver) `Via Router Only`.

This can have various causes and therefore different solutions:

**The distance between EZCast Pro Dongle II and the router or wireless access point is too great.**

Try to reduce the distance or install an additional wireless access point.

**There are walls or other objects between the EZCast Pro Dongle II and the router or wireless access point that degrade the signal strength.**

Make sure that the EZCast Pro Dongle II has no obstacles to the router or access point. If necessary, install an additional access point.

## Accessories

### USB Power Supply (5V/2A) {#Samsung_USB_Power_Supply_5V_2A}

The EZCast Pro Dongle II requires a stable power supply of at least 5V/1.5A. Although a USB port is available on many projectors and displays, unfortunately the power level is often insufficient. Without a sufficient power supply the Dongle might be able to power on however it will cause performance problems. If in doubt whether your projector or display can supply sufficient power, we recommend using an external power supply (5V/2A):

The [Samsung USB Power Supply (5V/2A)](https://www.amazon.de/USB-Netz-Ladeger%C3%A4t-Adapter-SAMSUNG-ETAU90EWE-Wei%C3%9F/dp/B00D2D9LF2/ref=sr_1_64?s=ce-de&ie=UTF8&qid=1531483723&sr=1-64&keywords=USB+charger) provides a USB port with 5V/2A for the EZCast Pro Dongle II.

### 2in1 Socket Adapter USB Power Supply {#2in1_Socket_Adapter_USB_Power_Supply}

Do you only have one power outlet available for the projector or screen? Then you can use a [2in1 Socket Adapter USB Power Supply](https://www.amazon.de/benon-B2192-Steckdosen-Adapter-Anschluss-Weiss-Wei%C3%9F/dp/B07JYDHL1V/ref=sr_1_57?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=2in1-Steckdose+und+USB-Netzteil+%285V%2F2A%29&qid=1580911098&sr=8-57).

### Female Socket to C14 Power Adapter

If the projector is mounted on the ceiling with only the power cable accessable, the question arises how to power the projector and the EZCast Pro Dongle II together, without having to call the electrician to carry out significant work. 

A simple solution is to use the [Adapter](https://www.amazon.de/Stromadapter-Schuko-Buchse-Kaltger%C3%A4te-Stecker/dp/B006B72TW8/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=Stromadapter+Schuko+Buchse+auf+Kaltger%C3%A4te+Stecker&qid=1580913979&sr=8-3) below in order to provide easy access to a standard power socket. This can be used in combination with a [2in1 Socket Adapter USB Power Supply](#2in1_Socket_Adapter_USB_Power_Supply) to provide power to both the EZCast Pro and the display device.
