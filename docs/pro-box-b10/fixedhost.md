# Fixed Host

Are you a teacher of a classroom? Or presenter of a conference room? By default, the first person to connect to the EZCast Pro Dongle II is assigned designated the moderator (Host) role.

You can however designate yourself as the permanent host of the EZCast Pro Dongle II. This means that even if you are the last to connect to the EZCast Pro device, the role of host will be transferred to you.

## Am I currently a Host or Guest?

In the software for Windows/macOS the role of Host/Guest is indicated, as shown below:
