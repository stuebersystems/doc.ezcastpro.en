# Data Security

The second generation EZCast Pro, the EZCast Pro Dongle II and the EZCast Pro Box II, use the **5 Ghz (802.11 ac)** wireless standard and authentication protocol **WPA2-PSK** by default to encrypt data over Wi-Fi. Legacy mode uses **2.4 Ghz (802.11b/g/n)** wireless standard and **WPA2-PSK** authentication protocol to encrypt data over Wi-Fi.

The first generation of EZCast Pro, the EZCast Pro Dongle I and the Pro LAN Box, use the **2.4 Ghz (802.11b/g/n)** wireless standard and authentication protocol **WPA2-PSK** to encrypt data over Wi-Fi.

All devices provide further security of data when restricting services to only one embedded **web server (thttpd)** and **EZCast Pro software service**. Changes made to the receiver by the user via the web server are permanently stored in a non-volatile NAND flash.
